# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple tic-tac-toe game built with React.

## Components
### Dependencies
- `react`: The core React library.
- `react-dom`: The package for working with the DOM in React applications.
- `react-scripts`: Scripts and configurations used by Create React App for building, testing, and running the application.

## Functionality
1. Game Board: The game provides a 3x3 grid as the game board where players can make their moves.
2. Player Interaction: Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on empty squares of the grid.
3. Winning Condition: The game automatically detects if there is a winner by checking for three marks of the same type in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
4. Game History: The game keeps track of the moves made during the game, allowing players to review the game's progression.
5. Jump to Move: Players can jump to any previous move in the game history to review or replay from that point onwards.
6. Restart Game: Players have the option to restart the game at any time, either when there is a winner or when the game ends in a draw.
7. User Interface: The game provides a user-friendly interface for playing tic-tac-toe, with clear status updates and prompts for the players.

## Usage
- Ensure you have Node.js installed.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
